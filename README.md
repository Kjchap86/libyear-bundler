# Libyear

A simple measure of software dependency freshness

A libyear (library year) is a measure of how old a software dependency is.

If your system has two dependencies, the first one year old, the second three,
then your system is four libyears out-of-date.

A dependency is one year old when the version you are using is one year older
than its latest version.
